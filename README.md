# Microservice Design Patterns

This repository contains a collection of design patterns for building microservices, which are small, independent, and modular services that work together to form a larger application.

## Getting Started

To use these design patterns, you will need a basic understanding of microservice architecture and design principles. Each pattern is described in detail in its own subdirectory, which includes code samples and explanations of how to implement the pattern.

- Service Registry
- Circuit Breaker
- Bulkhead
- API Gateway
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
